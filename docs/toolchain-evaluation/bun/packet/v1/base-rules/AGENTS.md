# AGENTS.md

Agent-Team: Electron (Vue 3 + TypeScript, pnpm) frontend + Python (uv) backend.
This file is a router — read the referenced file BEFORE doing the matching work.

## Route table

| Situation | Read first |
|---|---|
| Dev setup, tests, typecheck, PR and commit rules | `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| Process boundaries, ownership, persistence and trust boundaries | `docs/en-US/architecture.md` |
| Adding or changing an agent CLI integration | `docs/en-US/cli-extension-guide.md` |
| Building or changing a plugin | `docs/en-US/plugin-development.md` |
| Editor, diff, or plan surfaces | `docs/en-US/editor-design.md` |
| Keyboard shortcuts and the key resolver | `docs/en-US/keybindings.md` |

Read routed files on demand, not all up front.

An optional machine-local overlay may exist at `.Codex/playbook/` and
`~/.Codex/playbook/` for delegation and model-choice guidance. Neither is
checked in, so a fresh clone will not have them. Read them when present; never
block on them — every rule required to work in this repo is in this file or the
routed in-repo docs above.

## Always-on rules (the expensive-to-violate subset)

1. **Tests**: `pnpm test:run`, never `pnpm test` (watch mode hangs). Backend:
   `uv --project backend run pytest backend/tests` (the path argument is
   required — without it pytest misses backend's ini config). Run verification
   commands bare — no pipe to tail/head (it eats the exit code).
2. **Never clear terminal scrollback** — no `term.clear()` in any
   resize/redraw path.
3. **No self-initiated commits** — the user decides when to commit, unless
   they explicitly authorized committing for the task.
4. **No UI automation** (cliclick/screencapture/AppleScript) — the user tests
   UI manually.
5. **Giant files** — any file over ~2K lines: Grep tool to locate → Read with
   offset/limit → batch edits through one subagent. Never whole-file Read,
   never bash/python inline search. The largest, as of v0.1.75, are
   `src/renderer/src/App.vue` (~11.8K lines),
   `backend/agent_team_backend/ws_handlers.py` (~5.0K),
   `src/renderer/src/components/GitPane.vue` (~3.5K),
   `src/renderer/src/components/SettingsModal.vue` (~3.0K),
   `backend/agent_team_backend/usage_service.py` (~2.9K),
   `src/renderer/src/components/ControlPane.vue` (~2.8K),
   `backend/agent_team_backend/git_service.py` (~2.7K),
   `src/renderer/src/EditorWindowApp.vue` (~2.7K), and
   `src/renderer/src/composables/useTerminal.ts` (~2.6K). Check with `wc -l`
   rather than trusting this list — it drifts.

## Workflow (Plan Documents)

Plan mode is **opt-in only** — enter it solely when the user explicitly asks
(e.g. "建立計畫", "plan 模式"). Never create a plan file proactively, even for
complex tasks; without a plan, state assumptions and implement directly.

When a plan exists or was explicitly requested:

1. Plans are agent-authored HTML in `.agent-team/plans/` per
   `.agent-team/plans/_spec.md` (copy `_template.html` to start). The user
   views them in the app.
2. Updates (todo status, stage, review notes): edit only the `plan-meta`
   JSON block plus its matching visible markup — never rewrite the file.
3. Approval gate: write code only when the plan's `stage` is `approved` or
   later. The user saying "開始" means: set `stage: approved` + `approvedAt`,
   then start.
4. Legacy `.cursor/plans/*.plan.md` stay readable; never create new ones.

## Language

**Codebase language: English** — all code, comments, commit messages, variable
names, and in-repo documentation.

## Behavioral core

1. **Think first**: state assumptions; if multiple readings exist, list them —
   don't pick silently; if truly unclear, ask.
2. **Minimum code**: only what was asked; no speculative abstraction,
   flexibility, or impossible-case error handling.
3. **Surgical changes**: every changed line maps to the request; don't
   "improve" adjacent code; clean up only orphans your own change created.
4. **Goal-driven**: turn the task into verifiable acceptance criteria before
   coding ("fix bug" → "write a reproducing test, make it pass"), then loop
   until they verify.
