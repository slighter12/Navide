"""On-disk registry of live PTY child process groups.

PTY children are spawned with start_new_session=True (own process group), so
a backend that dies without running its shutdown sweep (SIGKILL, crash) leaves
them behind as orphans. Every spawn is recorded here and removed on close; at
startup, entries left over from a previous run are identity-checked and their
process groups killed.

Identity is the process start time (osplat.process_tree.start_time — ps
lstart on POSIX, the creation time on Windows), not the command line: shells
spawned as `zsh -lc <cmd>` exec the final command, so the visible command
never matches the spawn argv, while pid+start-time survives exec and defeats
pid recycling. The registry keeps calling the field `lstart` so entries
written by earlier backend versions stay readable. Each entry also records the owning backend pid so a second
backend sharing the data dir never reaps a live sibling's children.

Entries additionally carry the root's last descendant snapshot (pid -> lstart,
persisted by terminals' snapshot loop): killpg on the root's process group
misses grandchildren that detached into their own group (e.g. MCP servers a
CLI spawns), so reap_stale identity-checks and kills those individually — for
dead-owner entries whose root is still alive AND for roots that already died
on their own while the backend was down (their orphans outlive them).
