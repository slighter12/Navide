"""Structural tests for the per-vendor registry.

These are the CI guardrails of the one-file-per-vendor refactor:

* drift — the registry's key set must stay in lockstep with every other
  place a vendor list exists (install detection, log readers, frontend
  specs), so "added a vendor but forgot a spot" fails here instead of
  surfacing at runtime;
* import graph — vendor modules must stay self-contained (no vendor→vendor
  or vendor→app edges), which is what keeps "add a vendor" a one-file PR.

# (kilo reuses opencode's) is attributed to the module that really defines
# it instead of to the empty subclass file. Reading the frontend flag from
# here is just a regex over four `.ts` files, which this module already does
# for the vendor key set. The mirror-image test in vitest would have to fake
# Python inheritance by hand.

# constant makes every silence-inferring vendor look like a record-reading
# one. The failure message says so; keep the pattern below in sync with the
