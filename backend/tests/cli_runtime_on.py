"""``pytest -p tests.cli_runtime_on``: run a suite with the Rust CLI runtime switch on.

Every registered vendor's reader class has its three record calls routed the
way ``cli_runtime.wrap`` routes a production reader, and the switch is turned
on, so the readers tests build directly (``CodexLogReader()``) answer through
the ``navide-cli-runtime`` process too. Vendors the runtime does not observe,
and any call it cannot answer, stay on Python exactly as in production.

A routed call that ends on Python would pass every test while proving nothing
about the runtime, so the run counts each call's outcome per CLI, prints the
counts at the end, and fails when one fell back on a fault (a process that
died or stalled, an error answer) or declined a store that is not listed in
``EXPECTED_UNSUPPORTED``.

The few tests that meter the Python reader's own file reads are skipped, with
the reason shown (``PYTHON_READ_METERS``).

Needs a release build: ``cargo build --release`` in native/navide-cli-runtime.
