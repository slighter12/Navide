  //    an unreachable backend); the screen keeps asserting for as long as the
  //    box is painted.
  //  • AskUserQuestion has no notification type of its own, and its record
  //    only reaches the conversation log once the ANSWER is written — measured
  //    at 5m16s after the box appeared, in the same batch as the event that
  //    clears it. The log route is structurally too late; only the screen is
  //    on time.
  //
  // Two anchors, either of which is enough. The first is the permission box's
  // last option, identical across its edit / command / MCP variants. The
  // second is the option-picker footer, which AskUserQuestion and the
  // permission box both draw and neither leaves behind: answering repaints it
  // away, and the watcher re-checks every poll, so a stale match cannot hold.
