## Development Setup / 開發環境設定

**Requirements:** Node.js 22.12+ (22.x), pnpm 10+, Python 3.12+, uv 0.11+, Go 1.27.x
for the packaged Plans fixture, and macOS 13+ on Apple silicon, Linux x64, or Windows x64

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nt-nerdtechnic/Navide.git
cd Navide

pnpm install
uv --project backend sync

pnpm dev
```

The `pnpm dev` command starts Electron, Vite dev server, and the Python FastAPI backend together.

The first development start packages the production Plans backend with
`uv`/PyInstaller. Later starts reuse it when the Python sources, build script,
dependency files, resolved interpreter, platform, architecture, and executable
contents are unchanged. Missing or changed output is rebuilt automatically.
`pnpm run build:plans:backend` always rebuilds it explicitly; production and CI
builds remain unconditional — only `pnpm dev` passes `--if-needed`, and the
build script honours the opt-out below on that invocation alone.

Without `uv`/PyInstaller that build fails and `pnpm dev` stops before Electron
starts. To work on anything else in the meantime, skip it:

```bash
NAVIDE_SKIP_PLANS_BACKEND_BUILD=1 pnpm dev
```

The app then starts without the packaged Plans backend: the Host finds no
backend entry on disk, so the Plans v2 package is not registered and Plans runs
through its legacy recovery window instead. Every other surface — terminals,
Git, the editor — is unaffected. Never set this for a production or CI build:
invoked without `--if-needed` (`pnpm build`, `pnpm dist`, the CI gates) the
script fails with a message naming the variable rather than shipping a release
with no packaged Plans backend.

> 沒有 `uv`/PyInstaller 時用 `NAVIDE_SKIP_PLANS_BACKEND_BUILD=1 pnpm dev` 跳過打包，
> Plans 會以 legacy recovery 視窗運作，其他功能不受影響。

> `pnpm dev` 會同時啟動 Electron、Vite dev server 和 Python FastAPI backend。

### Git hooks

Point Git at the tracked hooks once per clone:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

`.githooks/pre-commit` refuses a commit whose staged `.ts`/`.vue`/`.py` files
import a relative module that is not in the index. Several sessions share one
working tree here, so a commit can carry a file that references a sibling still
unstaged or untracked; the local typecheck passes because the file is on disk,
and only CI fails. Stage the missing file too or drop the import; `--no-verify`
bypasses the check when you know what you are doing.

> 每個 clone 執行一次 `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`。pre-commit 會擋下
> 「staged 的檔 import 了還沒進 index 的相對模組」——本機 typecheck 看得到工作樹的檔所以會過，
> 只有 CI 會紅。

## Submitting a Pull Request / 提交 PR

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature
   ```
2. Make your changes.
3. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pnpm test:run
   uv --project backend run pytest backend/tests
   ```
4. Run type checks:
   ```bash
   pnpm typecheck
   ```
5. If you touched the cross-device path (`server_link.py`, `remote_roster.py`,
   `trust_store.py`, or the Navide-Server wire protocol), run the end-to-end
   check against a local server. The in-process tests use a fake server, so they
   agree with whatever this repository believes the contract is — including
   where it is wrong. This one talks to the real thing:
   ```bash
   NAVIDE_WS=ws://localhost:8787/ws \
     uv --project backend run python backend/scripts/verify_server_link.py
   ```

   > 動到跨裝置那條路徑時必跑。in-process 測試用的是假 server，會照著我們對契約
   > 的理解回應——包含理解錯的地方；這一支打的是真的對端。
6. Commit your changes following the [commit format](#commit-format) below.
7. Push and open a pull request against `main`.

Please fill in the pull request template — include a summary of changes and how you tested them.

CI retains complete frontend and backend suites on macOS, Linux and Windows.
Static checks run once, while application builds and artifact integration tests
run separately from ordinary frontend tests. The `Lint and test` status requires
the test/build matrices, packaged Plans, marketplace contracts, deterministic
speech sidecar tests and dependency audit to succeed. CI does not run Electron
UI automation; test UI changes manually. To reproduce the build check locally,
run `pnpm build`. See [CI and CLI regression infrastructure](docs/en-US/ci-and-cli-regression.md)
for suite ownership, provider isolation, contract coverage and diagnostics.

> Fork 後建立 feature branch，跑測試與型別檢查無誤後，依照下方 commit 格式提交，並開 PR 至 `main`。

## Code Style / 程式碼風格

**TypeScript / Vue**
- Match existing style and patterns in the codebase.
- No new dependencies without prior discussion in an Issue.

**Python**
- Follow PEP 8.
- Run the complete backend suite with `uv --project backend run pytest backend/tests` before committing. Focused runs such as `-m cli_regression` supplement this check; they never replace it.

**Adding a CLI agent**
- Follow [`docs/adding-a-cli-vendor.md`](docs/adding-a-cli-vendor.md). An
  integration is two vendor spec files plus registration — never an
  `if agent_key == "<yours>"` branch in a shared module.

**Tests that have to pass on macOS, Linux and Windows**

CI runs both suites on all three. Most tests that fail on only one platform
are correct code plus a test that answered a platform question itself instead
of asking the seam the code under test asks. Two rules keep that out:

- *Do not build a platform-dependent value by a different route than the
  module under test.* If the module gets a path from `join()`, a PATH from
  `os.pathsep`, a shell from `osplat.paths.shell_command()`, or kills through
  `osplat.process_tree.kill()`, the test uses the same call — never a
  `'/tmp/…'` literal as a fake-fs key, a `.split(":")`, a bare `/bin/sh`, or a
  stub of `os.kill` under that module. The two spellings agree on the platform
  you wrote the test on and disagree on exactly one other; and a stub that
  lands under the seam does something worse than fail there — on Windows
  `os.kill` is never reached, the real call raises an equivalent error, and
  the test passes while executing none of what it claims. Stub the seam for
  *which* pids are signalled; only a test about *how* (the signal itself) may
  stub `os.kill`, gated on the capability (`skipif(not hasattr(signal,
  "SIGKILL"))` — say what you need, not which OS you think you are on). A
  literal that is a spec constant (`STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT`) or a value the test
  itself set is fine to assert; a value the current platform decides (an OS
  error message) is not. `backend/tests/test_cross_platform_test_hygiene.py`
  and `src/main/crossPlatformTestHygiene.test.ts` ratchet the shapes that can be
  matched statically; the rest is this paragraph.
- *Take the platform as an input; do not ask the host.* Code that computes
  another platform's paths should take the platform as a parameter and pick
  `path.win32`/`path.posix` (or the osplat layout class) from it, the way
  `resolveBackendDataDir` in `src/main/ui-settings-bootstrap.ts` does. Then a
  test can assert all three answers on any runner — the fastest one, minutes
  before the Windows job reports. `src/main/backend-ws-token-parity.test.ts`
  does exactly this: the macOS runner asserts the Linux answer by driving
  `_linux.LinuxLayout` directly and comparing with the Python side.

**Running the backend suite as Windows before pushing**

The Windows CI job takes 20+ minutes round-trip, and most of what it catches
is the first rule above. `backend/tests/osplat_win_swap.py` catches that class
on this machine in minutes: it swaps `osplat.paths` (optionally
`osplat.platform_id`) for the Windows implementation before anything imports
the feature code, so every `home_env_var()` / `config_home()` /
`shell_command()` caller computes the Windows answer and every seam-keyed
skip falls the way it falls on Windows.

```sh
# the files you touched — seconds
OSPLAT_SWAP=paths uv --project backend run pytest backend/tests/test_host_shell.py -p tests.osplat_win_swap
# the whole suite — a couple of minutes
OSPLAT_SWAP=paths,platform_id uv --project backend run pytest backend/tests -p tests.osplat_win_swap
```

The swapped run has about 300 extra skips — the tests that drive a real
`git`/`gh` through the seam,
which the Windows resolver (`PATHEXT`: `git.exe`, never `git`) cannot find
on a POSIX host. The CLI coverage gate also rejects skipped required cases;
a swapped full run can therefore fail that gate and does not qualify as a
native-platform result. Prefer focused files for this diagnostic. A new
assertion failure here can indicate a test that answered a platform question
by a different route than the code under test — fix the test the way the
rule above says, not by gating it on `sys.platform`. A test that needs a
real program says so through the seam too:
`skipif(osplat.paths.resolve_program("git") is None)` for a binary,
`osplat.paths.executable_candidates("gh") != ["gh"]` for a `#!/bin/sh` fake
found by bare name. (The run also writes
`backend/agent_team_backend/git_askpass_helper.cmd`, as Windows does; it is
gitignored.) The swapped run finishes sooner only because those skipped
tests are the subprocess-heavy ones — every `git_service` test spawns real
git several times — not because anything runs faster; it runs fewer tests,
so it is a second pass before pushing, never a replacement for the normal
run.

What it verifies: path and environment arithmetic (`APPDATA`, `USERPROFILE`,
`PATHEXT` candidate lists, `cmd.exe` argv shapes), seam-keyed skips, and the
feature code that branches on `platform_id`. What it cannot verify requires a
real Windows host (CI, or a VM): a real DPAPI round-trip (`CryptProtectData`),
real `icacls` ACLs, the `ctypes.WinDLL` prototype bindings and `_win_error`,
real `CommandLineToArgvW` parsing, Job Object kill-on-close semantics,
ConPTY I/O / EOF / resize, the `WinError 1314` symlink branch, psutil's
Windows-only `private` / `peak_wset` fields, whether the rendered PowerShell
hook scripts actually run, and the win-only `sys.platform` arms inside the
`test_osplat.py` allowlist. Do not swap `secret_files`, `terminal_backend`,
`process_tree` or `resource_probe` to get at those: their Windows
implementations reach `WinDLL`, `winpty` and `icacls` at call time, so on a
POSIX host every caller fails on the missing binding, not on anything the
test asserts (the plugin refuses them for that reason).

The native Windows suite does exercise real ConPTY output, EOF and process-tree
cleanup in `backend/tests/test_windows_conpty_real.py`; its basic resize test
checks that resizing succeeds. Those guarantees come from the Windows run,
not the swapped-platform run, and do not certify a frozen release's bundled
console host.

> 請與現有程式碼風格保持一致。Python 提交前請執行完整 backend tests。
> 新增 CLI 整合請依 `docs/adding-a-cli-vendor.md`，一家一檔，不要在共用模組加分支。
> 測試要在三個平台都過：不要繞過被測程式用的 seam 自己造路徑／平台答案
> （`join()`、`os.pathsep`、`osplat.*`——被測程式怎麼拿，測試就怎麼拿；stub 停在 seam，
> 不停在 seam 底下的 `os.kill`）；算別的平台的路徑時把 platform 當參數傳、不要問 host，
> 這樣三個平台的答案在任何 runner 都能斷言。
> 推 CI 前先用 `-p tests.osplat_win_swap` 把後端 suite 當 Windows 跑一次（改到的檔案幾秒、全套約十分鐘）；
> 它只換 `osplat.paths`／`platform_id`，換不到 DPAPI／ConPTY／Job Object 那些真實行為——那些只有 Windows CI 或 VM 驗得到。

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating you agree to abide by its terms.

> 本專案遵循 [Contributor Covenant 行為準則](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)，參與即表示同意遵守。

## Documentation

User-facing behavior changes must update the relevant canonical document under [`docs/en-US/`](docs/en-US/README.md), synchronize an existing localized counterpart in the same change, and add an entry under `CHANGELOG.md`'s Unreleased section. Avoid describing configurable registries with fixed counts, document any new external data flow in `docs/en-US/privacy.md`, and keep future vision distinct from shipped capability claims.

A release announces itself in the app: add the version's What's New entry — its highlights and, optionally, a guided tour — as described in [Release announcements](docs/en-US/release-announcements.md). `./release.sh` prints a warning when the version being released has no entry.
